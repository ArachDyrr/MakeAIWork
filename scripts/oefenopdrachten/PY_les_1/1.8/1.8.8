##Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers (use three separate input statements). Create variables called total and average that hold the sum and average of the three numbers and print out the values of total and average.
a = eval(input('Please provide the first number.' ))
b = eval(input('Please provide the secund number.' ))
c = eval(input('Please provide the third number.' ))

total = a+b+c  
average = total/3

print ('The total of the three numbers is: ',total)
print ('The average of the three numbers is: ',average)

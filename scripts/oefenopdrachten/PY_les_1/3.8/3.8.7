##Write a program that asks the user to enter an angle between -180° and 180°. Using an expression with the modulo operator, convert the angle to its equivalent between 0° and 360°.

##(8+6)%12 is equal to 2.
##player = player%5+1

angle_1 = int(input('enter an angle between -180 and 180 :'))
angle_2 = (angle_1)%360

print (angle_2)

##Write a program that generates 50 random numbers such that the first number is between 1 and 2, the second is between 1 and 3, the third is between 1 and 4, …, and the last is between 1 and 51.

##"{:02d}".format(result) is used in the line with randint(1,51) to make sure that a result of 1-9 will display as 01-09 so that all printed data will have the same number of didgits. 

from random import randint

for i in range (5):
    print ((randint(1,2)),
    (randint(1,3)),
    (randint(1,4)),
    ("{:02d}".format(randint(1,51))),
    sep='')
